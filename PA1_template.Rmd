### Basic settings
```{r}
echo = TRUE  # Always make code visible
options(scipen = 1)  # Turn off scientific notations for numbers
```

# 1. Code for reading in the dataset and/or processing the data
```{r}
filename <- unzip("repdata-data-activity.zip")
activity <- read.csv(filename, stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
str(activity)

# Format of Date

activity$date <- as.Date(activity$date)
str(activity)
```
# 2. Histogram of the total number of steps taken each day
```{r}
activity_rm<-activity[which(!is.na(activity$steps)),]
perday<-tapply(activity_rm$steps, activity_rm$date, sum)
hist(perday,10, main = "Total number of steps taken per day", xlab = "")
```
# 3. Mean and median number of steps taken each day
```{r}
mean(perday)
```
```{r}
median(perday)
```
# 4. Time series plot of the average number of steps taken
```{r}
dailyact<-tapply(activity_rm$steps, activity_rm$interval, mean)
plot(y = dailyact, x = names(dailyact), type = "l", xlab = "5-Minute-Interval", 
    main = "Daily Activity Pattern", ylab = "Average number of steps")
```
# 5 The 5-minute interval that, on average, contains the maximum number of steps
```{r}
dailyact[dailyact==max(dailyact)]
```
#6 Code to describe and show a strategy for imputing missing data
```{r}
sum(is.na(activity$steps))
sum(is.na(activity))
act_new <- activity
act_new[which(is.na(act_new$steps)),1]<-
        dailyact[as.character(act_new[which(is.na(act_new$steps)),3])]
sum(is.na(act_new))
```
# 7 Histogram of the total number of steps taken each day after missing values are imputed
```{r}
perday_new<-tapply(act_new$steps, act_new$date, sum)
par(mfrow=c(1,2))
hist(perday,10, main = "Total number of steps taken per day", xlab = "Steps"
     , ylim =c(0, 25))
abline(v = median(perday), col = 4, lwd = 4)     
hist(perday_new,10, main = "Total number of steps taken per day  
     (missing values replaced with mean of interval)", xlab = "Steps",
     ylim =c(0, 25))     
abline(v = median(perday_new), col = 4, lwd = 4)     
```

#8 Panel plot comparing the average number of steps taken per 5-minute interval across weekdays and weekends
```{r}

act_new$wd<-weekdays(act_new$date)
act_new$fwd<- as.factor(c("weekend", "weekday"))
act_new[act_new$wd == "Sunday" | act_new$wd == "Saturday" ,5]<- factor("weekend")
act_new[!(act_new$wd == "Sunday" | act_new$wd == "Saturday"),5 ]<- factor("weekday")

act_new_we <- subset(act_new, fwd == "weekend") 
act_new_wd <- subset(act_new, fwd == "weekday") 
dailyact_we<-tapply(act_new_we$steps, act_new_we$interval, mean)
dailyact_wd<-tapply(act_new_wd$steps, act_new_wd$interval, mean)
par(mfrow=c(2,1))
plot(y = dailyact_wd, x = names(dailyact_wd), type = "l", xlab = "5-Minute Interval", 
     main = "Daily Activity Pattern on Weekdays", ylab = "Average number of steps", 
     ylim =c(0, 250))
plot(y = dailyact_we, x = names(dailyact_we), type = "l", xlab = "5-Minute Interval", 
     main = "Daily Activity Pattern on Weekends", ylab = "Average number of steps", 
     ylim =c(0, 250))

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
summary(cars)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
